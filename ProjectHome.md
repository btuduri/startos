Write your ARM programs in an easy, clear native manner.

Reduce your development time to a minimum.

ARM SoC is considered as a simple microcontroller but with 32-bit, MIPS, Megabytes of RAM and Gigabytes of external storage memory!

Based on cheapest ARM9 Development Board (about $80 for the FriendlyARM mini2440 w/ a color 3.5" LCD or Samsung SBC 2440 ARM9).

Porting to **Cortex A8** is ready and waits its turn. All functions are adopted&tested on the FriendlyARM mini210s Development Board (must also work on Samsung SBC X210).


All projects were 100% tested and work under StartOS - small operating system for ARM platform.
It's simple, fast, reliable, user-friendly op sys with  time-proved characteristics taken from mini-, microcomputers, Handhelds and microcontrollers.
Features are: shortest booting time - about one second, loading and launching User's programs from an SD card into the RAM, System APIs are working via software interrupts, granting a User total control over hardware, native C, C++ and Assembler programming. Clear and extremely small programs.



StartOS is free of charge for education and evaluation purposes.

For commercial use of StartOS please contact Anatoly Besplemennov (longtolik@gmail.com).

StartOS isn't open source just by simple reasons. Project's ideology and algorithms are controlled by one person. The code is very compact, carefully cleaned and optimized. Author still keeps the hope to find a sponsor for speed up the development.

**_Note.You can test the new version launching StartOS binary from an SD card. Next, burn it into the NAND flash_**
